## Executive Summary

This analysis examined 64,815 flight diversions across the United States from July 2021 to December 2024, identifying 3 distinct diversion clusters and uncovering patterns in when, where, and how flights are redirected from their intended destinations.

**Main Finding**: Flight diversions are not random; they cluster around specific hub airports during specific time periods, suggesting systematic operational vulnerabilities in the U.S. aviation system.

---

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: American Airlines Shows Significantly Higher Diversion Rates Than Competitors

**The Discovery**: 
American Airlines (AA) accounts for 27.7% of all diversions (18,004 of 64,815) despite operating a similar flight volume to Delta (DL: 16.8%, 10,886 diversions) and United (UA: 21.4%, 13,921 diversions). This disparity suggests operational differences in how AA manages disruptions compared to similarly-sized competitors.

**Evidence**:
- American Airlines: 18,004 diversions (27.7% of total)
- United Airlines: 13,921 diversions (21.4%)
- Delta Air Lines: 10,886 diversions (16.8%)
- AA diverts 29% more frequently than DL despite similar fleet sizes

**Why It Matters**:
Higher diversion rates indicate either: (1) more aggressive scheduling in challenging conditions, (2) less efficient operational recovery procedures, or (3) different network design vulnerabilities. For passengers, this means AA flights are more likely to experience disruptions. For AA, this represents a competitive disadvantage and cost burden.

**Related Pattern**:
AA appears prominently in all three cluster periods (SAN, DFW, ORD), suggesting systemic rather than isolated issues across their network.

---

### Finding 2: Regional vs. System-Wide Disruptions Require Different Operational Responses

**The Discovery**: 
Diversion clusters fall into two categories: regional events (where 50-60% of diversions go to the primary airport) and system-wide cascades (where only 48% go to primary, with remainder spreading across 60+ destinations). These patterns reveal how disruptions propagate through the aviation network.

**Evidence**:
- **System-wide event (SAN)**: Only 48.3% to primary, 290 total diversions across 60 destinations
- **Regional events (DFW, ORD)**: 57-59% to primary, concentrated in regional airports (Texas hub, Midwest corridor)
- System-wide events generate 50-100% more total diversions than regional ones
- Arrival delays average 278.8 minutes, suggesting significant cascade effects

**Visualizations**:

#### San Diego (SAN) - Individual Cluster Map
![SAN Individual Cluster](cascade_cluster_1_SAN.png)
*Shows 140 diversions specifically to SAN, with origins concentrated on West Coast and Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX) as primary diversion airport*

#### San Diego (SAN) - System-Wide Context
![SAN System-Wide Map](system_wide_cluster_1_SAN.png)
*Reveals the broader impact: 290 total diversions across 60 destinations, showing how a single airport disruption cascades throughout the entire system*

#### Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) - Individual Cluster Map
![DFW Individual Cluster](cascade_cluster_2_DFW.png)
*Shows 110 diversions to DFW during Nov 4-5, 2024, with Houston (IAH) as primary alternate and origins spanning the country*

#### Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) - System-Wide Context
![DFW System-Wide Map](system_wide_cluster_2_DFW.png)
*Demonstrates regional concentration: 186 total diversions stay concentrated in Texas/South-Central region, unlike the SAN system-wide cascade*

#### Chicago O'Hare (ORD) - Individual Cluster Map
![ORD Individual Cluster](cascade_cluster_3_ORD.png)
*Shows 108 diversions to ORD during Aug 24-26, 2021, with Indianapolis (IND) as primary alternate and Midwest corridor absorption*

#### Chicago O'Hare (ORD) - System-Wide Context
![ORD System-Wide Map](system_wide_cluster_3_ORD.png)
*Reveals regional pattern: 187 total diversions concentrated in Midwest, showing Midwest corridor coordination similar to Texas pattern*

**Why It Matters**:
System-wide disruptions require network-wide coordination; regional events can be handled locally. Airlines that can quickly identify event scope and activate appropriate response protocols (local vs. system-wide) minimize passenger impact and operational costs.

**Related Pattern**:
SAN December 2024 event (system-wide) affected airlines' operations across coasts; DFW and ORD events (regional) stayed concentrated in their geographic areas, allowing more localized recovery.

---

### Finding 3: Diversion Hub Airports Show Consistent Geographic Patterns

**The Discovery**: 
The same airports repeatedly appear as primary diversion destinations (DEN, IAD, LAX, DFW, AUS) regardless of event type or airline, indicating they serve as the natural "safety valves" for the U.S. aviation system.

**Evidence**:
- Top 3 diversion airports: DEN (1,935), IAD (1,680), LAX (1,608)
- These airports account for significant portion of all diversions
- West Coast, Texas, and major hub cities consistently serve as overflow capacity
- Same airports appear in all three cluster visualizations

**Why It Matters**:
Airlines can pre-position crews, aircraft, and ground services at these hub airports to handle predictable diversions. Understanding which airports absorb diversions allows airlines to manage costs and improve recovery efficiency.

**Related Pattern**:
DFW cluster shows Texas airports (IAH, DFW, SAT, AUS) work together; ORD cluster shows Midwest corridor (IND, STL, MKE) handles overflow—airlines can leverage regional networks for better recovery planning.

## Operational Implications

### For Airlines

**Recommendation 1: Pre-Position Crews and Aircraft at Hub Diversion Airports**
- DEN, IAD, LAX consistently absorb diversions; position spare crews and aircraft there during high-risk periods
- Example: During winter months (peak diversion season), AA should have crew standby at DEN and PHX based on SAN cluster patterns
- Benefit: Reduces ground time and passenger delays by enabling immediate rebooking and crew swaps

**Recommendation 2: Implement Tiered Disruption Protocols Based on Event Scope**
- Train dispatch teams to identify system-wide vs. regional events within first 30 minutes
- Regional events: Activate local recovery (reroute through nearby hubs like IAH, IND, STL)
- System-wide events: Activate network-wide coordination with partner airlines
- Benefit: Faster response, better passenger communication, reduced cascading delays

**Recommendation 3: Address American Airlines' Elevated Diversion Rate**
- AA's 27.7% share of diversions (despite 18-22% market share by seats) suggests operational inefficiency
- Audit scheduling practices: Are routes over-scheduled relative to capacity?
- Review recovery procedures: Are crews, aircraft, or ground operations slower to recover than competitors?
- Benchmark against DL/UA best practices in disruption management
- Benefit: Competitive advantage, lower costs, improved on-time performance

**Recommendation 4: Route Planning Accounts for Regional Vulnerability Patterns**
- DFW/ORD events show that some routes are inherently riskier (e.g., flights to SAN during winter)
- Consider scheduling more flexible routing options or tighter buffers on historically problematic routes
- Benefit: Fewer diversions, better customer retention, reduced operational costs

### For Airport Operations

**Finding**: Major airports (DEN, IAD, LAX, DFW, ORD) experience consistent overflow diversion traffic. These airports need capacity planning that accounts for this "surge" demand.

**Operational Needs**:
- Gate availability: These hub airports need flex-gate agreements for sudden diversions
- Ground crew staffing: Surge staffing protocols during peak diversion periods
- Coordination with airlines: Pre-positioned spare aircraft and crews need dedicated parking/handling facilities

### For Policy Makers

**System-Level Insight**: The U.S. aviation system shows clear capacity vulnerabilities. System-wide events (like SAN December 2024) cascade across 60 destinations, suggesting the network is near saturation during peak periods.

**Implication 1**: Infrastructure investment should prioritize secondary airports that naturally absorb diversions (DEN, IAD, LAX) rather than adding capacity to already-congested hubs

**Implication 2**: ATC coordination protocols between regional hubs (like Texas airports or Midwest corridor) can mitigate cascade effects during disruptions

## What Surprised Us

**Surprise 1: American Airlines' Diversion Disparity**
- Expected: Similar diversion rates for similarly-sized carriers (AA, UA, DL)
- Found: AA diverts 29% more than DL despite comparable network size
- Explanation: Could reflect AA's more aggressive scheduling, different network vulnerabilities, or less efficient disruption recovery compared to competitors

**Surprise 2: System-Wide vs. Regional Event Distinction**
- Expected: Disruptions would affect multiple destinations equally
- Found: Some events (SAN) cascade across 60 destinations; others (DFW, ORD) stay concentrated in regions
- Explanation: Geographic location and airport connectivity determine how disruptions propagate—coastal/hub airports have more alternative routing options

**Surprise 3: Consistent Hub Diversion Pattern**
- Expected: Diversions would spread randomly across available airports
- Found: Same 10 airports (DEN, IAD, LAX, DFW, etc.) consistently absorb diversions
- Explanation: These airports have the capacity, geographic position, and service infrastructure that airlines naturally choose for diversions

## What This Reveals About Aviation

### The Bigger Picture

This analysis reveals that the U.S. aviation system operates with **predictable but exploitable vulnerabilities**:
- Diversion patterns cluster around specific airports and time periods
- Regional networks (Texas hub, Midwest corridor) successfully coordinate to handle disruptions
- Some airlines manage disruptions significantly better than others despite similar network sizes

### System Resilience

**Positive**: 
- Hub airports (DEN, IAD, LAX, DFW) successfully absorb diversions—the network has natural "safety valves"
- Regional coordination shows airlines can work together effectively during disruptions
- 50.6 average daily diversions represents only 0.1% of total U.S. flights, showing overall system stability

**Negative**: 
- System-wide events (like SAN) cascade across 60+ destinations, indicating limited redundancy in some network paths
- American Airlines' high diversion rate suggests operational inefficiencies can cascade through the network
- Average 278.8-minute arrival delay indicates diversions create significant downstream impacts

### Passenger Experience Implications

For the 64,815 passengers affected by these diversions over 45 months:
- Average delay impact: 278.8 minutes (4.6+ hours)
- System-wide events: Potential for missed connections and multi-day disruptions
- Regional events: Usually resolved within regional airport network with lower passenger impact

## Conclusion

Flight diversions in the U.S. aviation system are not random events but rather **systematic patterns** that cluster around specific airports during specific time periods. This analysis identified 3 major diversion clusters, each revealing distinct operational characteristics.

The findings suggest that:

1. **American Airlines operates with significantly higher diversion rates than competitors** - This represents both a competitive disadvantage and an opportunity for operational improvement through benchmarking against Delta and United's practices.

2. **Disruptions follow predictable geographic patterns** - System-wide events cascade across 60+ destinations while regional events stay concentrated. Airlines that quickly identify event scope and activate appropriate response protocols will minimize costs and passenger impact.

3. **Hub airports naturally absorb diversions** - DEN, IAD, LAX, DFW, and ORD serve as consistent "safety valves." Airlines that pre-position resources at these airports and understand regional coordination (Texas hub, Midwest corridor) can recover more efficiently from disruptions.

By understanding these patterns, airlines can:
- **American Airlines**: Audit scheduling and recovery procedures to match UA/DL efficiency
- **All Airlines**: Pre-position crews/aircraft at hub diversion airports during peak risk periods
- **Airports**: Plan capacity expansion to support consistent diversion traffic
- **Industry**: Improve network redundancy to reduce cascade effects during system-wide disruptions

This work demonstrates that publicly available transportation data, when combined with modern data science techniques, can reveal actionable insights into complex system behavior and competitive performance differences.

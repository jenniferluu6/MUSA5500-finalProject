## Welcome

This project analyzes flight diversions across the United States from July 2021 through December 2024, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). By combining temporal clustering analysis with interactive geospatial visualizations, we uncover patterns in when, where, and how flights are diverted from their intended destinations—and reveal significant differences in how airlines manage disruptions.

---

## Why This Matters

Flight diversions represent a significant disruption to both airlines and passengers. Understanding diversion patterns helps:

- **Airlines**: Optimize route planning and operational resilience. By identifying which airports, time periods, and routes are prone to diversions, airlines can pre-position aircraft, adjust crew schedules, and reroute flights proactively. American Airlines' 29% higher diversion rate reveals opportunities for operational improvement through benchmarking against Delta and United.

- **Airports**: Plan capacity for overflow demand. The analysis identifies consistent diversion hub airports (DEN, IAD, LAX) that naturally absorb system disruptions, informing infrastructure and ground service planning.

- **Policymakers**: Identify systemic bottlenecks in air traffic management. Diversion clusters reveal capacity constraints at specific airports and demonstrate how disruptions cascade through the network, informing infrastructure investment and ATC policy decisions.

- **Researchers**: Better understand the vulnerabilities and resilience patterns in the aviation system. Flight diversions expose how the network responds to disruptions and reveal dependencies between airports.

## Project Overview

### Key Findings

- **64,815 total diversions** documented from July 2021 through December 2024
- **25,386,632 total flights analyzed**, with 0.26% experiencing diversions
- **3 major diversion clusters** identified: San Diego (system-wide), Dallas/Fort Worth (regional), Chicago O'Hare (regional)
- **American Airlines** diverts 29% more frequently than Delta despite similar network size
- **System-wide events** cascade across 60+ destination airports; **regional events** stay concentrated in geography zones
- **Top diversion hubs**: Denver (1,935), Washington Dulles (1,680), Los Angeles (1,608)
- **Average arrival delay** for diverted flights: 278.8 minutes (4.6 hours)

### Methodology

This project follows a complete data science pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**: Aggregating 45 months of BTS OTMC-OTP data (25.4M flights) with FAA airport coordinates
2. **Data Cleaning**: Filtering for diversions, validation, removing duplicates, geocoding
3. **Analysis**: Temporal clustering (12-hour threshold) to identify disruption events
4. **Visualization**: Interactive Plotly maps showing individual and system-wide impacts
5. **Communication**: Clear documentation and actionable insights

## The Three Clusters

### Cluster 1: San Diego (December 2024) - System-Wide Disruption
- 140 diversions to SAN; 290 system-wide across 60 destinations
- Only 48.3% diverted to primary airport (cascaded across network)
- Affected 73 origin airports and 60 destination airports
- **Finding**: Coastal hub disruptions have broader ripple effects through the system

### Cluster 2: Dallas/Fort Worth (November 2024) - Regional Disruption  
- 110 diversions to DFW; 186 system-wide with regional concentration
- 59.1% diverted to primary airport (more localized recovery)
- Texas corridor airports (IAH, SAT, AUS) absorbed overflow
- **Finding**: Regional hubs keep diversions contained in geographic area

### Cluster 3: Chicago O'Hare (August 2021) - Regional Disruption
- 108 diversions to ORD; 187 system-wide with Midwest focus
- 57.8% diverted to primary airport (regional coordination)
- Midwest corridor (IND, STL, MKE) natural overflow network
- **Finding**: Hub location determines scope of cascade effects

## American Airlines: Why the Higher Diversion Rate?

American Airlines accounts for **27.7% of all diversions** despite operating roughly 18-22% of U.S. flights:

| Airline | Diversions | % of Total | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **American (AA)** | 18,004 | 27.7% | **Higher than market share** |
| United (UA) | 13,921 | 21.4% | Expected |
| Delta (DL) | 10,886 | 16.8% | **Better than expected** |
| Southwest (WN) | 10,285 | 15.8% | In line |
| Alaska (AS) | 3,922 | 6.0% | In line |

**Possible explanations:**
- More aggressive scheduling relative to airport capacity
- Less efficient operational recovery procedures
- Different network vulnerabilities (route design, hub exposure)
- Older fleet with higher mechanical diversion rates

This represents both a competitive disadvantage and an opportunity for operational improvement.

3. Benchmark operational practices against DL and UA
4. Monitor routes with historically high diversion risk

### For Airports:

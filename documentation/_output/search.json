    "text": "2 Why This Matters\nFlight diversions represent a significant disruption to both airlines and passengers. Understanding diversion patterns helps:\n\nAirlines: Optimize route planning and operational resilience. By identifying which airports, time periods, and recovery issues are prone to diversions, airlines can pre-position aircraft, adjust crew schedules, and reroute flights proactively. This minimizes operational costs and improves schedule reliability.\nPolicymakers: Identify systemic bottlenecks in air traffic management. Diversion clusters reveal capacity constraints at specific airports, informing infrastructure investment decisions and air traffic control policy.\nResearchers: Better understand the vulnerabilities and resilience patterns in the aviation system. Flight diversions expose how the network responds to disruptions and reveal dependencies between airports.",

Date Range Slider - Specify custom date ranges (July 2021 - December 2024) - Allows temporal analysis of diversions - Supports seasonal pattern exploration\n3. Dynamic Summary Statistics - Updates automatically when filters change - Displays: - Total diversions in filtered dataset - Number of unique diversion airports - Average departure delay (in minutes)\n\n\n2.2 Visualizations\n\n2.2.1 Top Diversion Airports Map\n\nInteractive geographic map showing the top 15 diversion airports\nMarker size represents frequency of diversions\nHover over airports to see exact diversion counts\nAllows geographic pattern identification\n\nWhat it shows: Which airports are receiving the most diverted flights during the selected time period and for chosen airlines.\nHow to interpret: Larger circles = more diversions. Geographic clusters suggest regional capacity issues.\n\n\n2.2.2 Diversions by Airline Bar Chart\n\nHorizontal bar chart ranking airlines by diversion count\nColors distinguish between airlines\nHover for exact numbers\n\nWhat it shows: How diversions are distributed across airlines in your filtered dataset.\nHow to interpret: Comparison of operational disruption frequency by carrier. May reflect differences in route networks, fleet size, or operational practices.\n\n\n2.2.3 Summary Statistics Cards\n\nThree key metrics displayed prominently\nBackground colors for quick visual scanning\nUpdate in real-time as filters change\n\nMetrics: 1. Total Diversions (Blue) - Sum of all diversions matching filters 2. Diversion Airports (Purple) - Count of unique airports receiving diversions 3.

When one major airport is affected, diversions cascade across the entire network, affecting other cities and regions. This is a true system-wide disruption event, not just a localized issue.\nInterpretation: Only about half of flights heading to SAN were diverted there.

    "text": "3 Methodology\n\n3.1 1. Temporal-Spatial Clustering Analysis\n\n3.1.1 Methodology: Time-Based Clustering\nA temporal clustering approach was used to identify distinct diversion events. Diversions are grouped by destination airport and time proximity, with the assumption that diversions occurring within a 12-hour window at the same destination airport are part of the same disruption event.\nClustering Algorithm:\n# Define temporal cluster: if time gap between diversions &gt; 12 hours, start new cluster\ndef dest_cluster(group, max_gap_hours=12):\n    group = group.sort_values('FlightDate')\n    group['time_since_last'] = group['FlightDate'].diff().dt.total_seconds() / 3600\n    group['new_cluster'] = (group['time_since_last'] &gt; max_gap_hours).fillna(True)\n    group['cluster_id'] = group['new_cluster'].cumsum()\n    return group\n\n# Apply clustering by destination\ndiverted_by_dest = diverted_by_dest.groupby('Dest', group_keys=False).apply(dest_cluster)\n\n# Aggregate cluster statistics\ncluster_summary_by_dest = diverted_by_dest.groupby(['Dest', 'cluster_id']).agg({\n    'FlightDate': ['min', 'max', 'count'],\n    'Origin': 'nunique',\n    'Div1Airport': lambda x: x.value_counts().index[0] if len(x) &gt; 0 else None\n})\nWhy this approach? - Temporal proximity (within 12 hours) indicates related disruptions at the same destination - Groups diversions by destination to identify which airports experience clustered events - Simple and interpretable: clusters represent real disruption events - Computationally efficient for large datasets\n\n\n3.1.2 Determining Cluster Significance\nThe 12-hour threshold was chosen because: - Allows for cascading effects (e.g., weather system lasting multiple hours) - Prevents false clustering of unrelated events days apart - Aligns with typical airline operational recovery timelines\nClusters with 50+ diversions were identified as major events warranting detailed analysis.\n\n\n3.1.3 Cluster Characteristics\nCluster 1: San Diego (SAN) System-Wide Disruption - Primary destination: SAN (San Diego International) - Common diversion airport: PHX (Phoenix Sky Harbor International) - Number of events: 140 diversions to SAN; 290 system-wide diversions - Time period: December 18-21, 2024 - Origins affected: 43 unique airports, with ATL, SFO, and DEN being most common - Characteristics: Widespread multi-airport event affecting 60 destination airports and 73 origin airports. Only 48.3% of diversions were to SAN itself; the remaining 150 diversions spread across other destinations (SNA, EYW, BOS, LAX, etc.), indicating a system-wide disruption cascade. Primary diversion airports were ONT (48), PHX (33), and LAX (32), suggesting West Coast capacity constraints.\nCluster 2: Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) Regional Disruption - Primary destination: DFW (Dallas/Fort Worth International) - Common diversion airport: IAH (George Bush Intercontinental, Houston) - Number of events: 110 diversions to DFW; 186 system-wide diversions - Time period: November 4-5, 2024 - Origins affected: 89 unique airports, with ATL, CLT, and BOS being most common - Characteristics: Regional event concentrated in Texas area with 59.1% of diversions directed to DFW. Secondary impacts on DAL (32), AUS (13), and SAT (12). Primary diversion airports clustered in Texas region: IAH (28), OKC (22), SAT (16), and AUS (11). Despite broad geographic origins, diversion pattern remained relatively localized to South-Central U.S.\nCluster 3: Chicago O’Hare (ORD) Regional Disruption - Primary destination: ORD (Chicago O’Hare International) - Common diversion airport: IND (Indianapolis International) - Number of events: 108 diversions to ORD; 187 system-wide diversions - Time period: August 24-26, 2021 - Origins affected: 87 unique airports, with ORD, LAX, DFW, and MSP being most common - Characteristics: Regional event affecting Midwest with 57.8% of diversions to ORD. Secondary impacts on MCO (19), MDW (14), and STL (9). Primary diversion airports: IND (24), STL (21), and MKE (17), indicating Midwest corridor used for overflow capacity. Despite broad geographic origins, diversions concentrated around ORD and neighboring Midwest airports.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 2. Geospatial Analysis\n\n3.2.1 Airport-Level Analysis\nAirport coordinates were used to create geographic visualizations and identify spatial patterns:\n# Get airport coordinates\ndef get_coords(airport_code, airport_df):\n    if airport_code in airport_df.index:\n        coords = airport_df.loc[airport_code]\n        return (coords['latitude'], coords['longitude'])\n    return (None, None)\n\n# Create flight paths using Bezier curves\ndef create_bezier_curve(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, num_points=100):\n    mid_lat = (lat1 + lat2) / 2\n    mid_lon = (lon1 + lon2) / 2\n    dx = lon2 - lon1\n    dy = lat2 - lat1\n    distance = np.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)\n    \n    # Calculate control point for Bezier curve\n    if distance &gt; 0:\n        offset = distance * 0.2\n        control_lat = mid_lat + offset * (dx / distance) * 0.15\n        control_lon = mid_lon - offset * (dy / distance) * 0.15\n    else:\n        control_lat = mid_lat\n        control_lon = mid_lon\n    \n    # Generate curve points\n    t = np.linspace(0, 1, num_points)\n    lats = [(1-ti)**2 * lat1 + 2*(1-ti)*ti * control_lat + ti**2 * lat2 for ti in t]\n    lons = [(1-ti)**2 * lon1 + 2*(1-ti)*ti * control_lon + ti**2 * lon2 for ti in t]\n    return lats, lons\n\n# Count diversions by airport\ndiv_counts = diverted_flights['Div1Airport'].value_counts()\ndest_counts = diverted_flights['Dest'].value_counts()\n\n\n3.2.2 Route Analysis\nFlight routes (Origin → Diversion → Destination) were visualized using interactive Plotly maps showing: - Blue markers: Origin airports - Red stars: Diversion airports - Gold diamonds: Intended destination airports - Curved lines: Flight paths colored by airline\nThis reveals: - Which airports are forced to absorb diversions - Geographic spread of disruption impacts - Airline-specific diversion patterns - Cascading effects across regions\n\n\n\n\n3.3 3. Statistical Analysis\n\n3.3.1 Delay Impact\nDeparture and arrival delays for diverted flights were calculated to understand operational impact:\n# Calculate delay statistics\navg_dep_delay = diverted_flights['DepDelay'].mean()\nmedian_dep_delay = diverted_flights['DepDelay'].median()\nmax_dep_delay = diverted_flights['DepDelay'].max()\n\navg_arr_delay = diverted_flights['ArrDelay'].mean()\nmedian_arr_delay = diverted_flights['ArrDelay'].median()\nmax_arr_delay = diverted_flights['ArrDelay'].max()\nKey Statistics: - Average departure delay for diverted flights: [X] minutes - Average arrival delay for diverted flights: [Y] minutes - Maximum single-flight delay: [Z] minutes\n\n\n3.3.2 Airline Comparison\nDiversions were analyzed by airline to identify operational differences:\n# Analyze diversions by airline\nairline_analysis = diverted_flights.groupby('Marketing_Airline_Network').agg({\n    'FlightDate': 'count',\n    'Div1Airport': 'nunique',\n    'DepDelay': 'mean',\n    'ArrDelay': 'mean'\n}).rename(columns={'FlightDate': 'num_diversions'})\n\nairline_analysis = airline_analysis.sort_values('num_diversions', ascending=False)\n\n\n\nAirline\nDiversion Count\nAvg Dep Delay\nAvg Arr Delay\n\n\n\n\n[Airline 1]\n[X]\n[A] min\n[B] min\n\n\n[Airline 2]\n[Y]\n[C] min\n[D] min\n\n\n[Airline 3]\n[Z]\n[E] min\n[F] min",

    "text": "6 Methodological Decisions\n\n6.1 Why Temporal Clustering with 12-Hour Threshold?\nThe approach was chosen because: 1. Interpretability: Clusters directly represent real disruption events 2. Domain alignment: 12-hour window matches airline operational recovery cycles 3. Simplicity: Easy to understand and reproduce 4. Efficiency: Computationally efficient for large datasets 5. Causality: Temporal proximity suggests shared root causes\n\n\n6.2 Why Group by Destination?\nGrouping by destination airport reveals: - Which airports are most vulnerable to cascading diversions - Geographic concentration vs. system-wide impact - Capacity constraints at specific locations - Ripple effects when one airport is overwhelmed\n\n\n6.3 Why Visualize with Bezier Curves?\nBezier curves were used for flight paths because: - Great circle routes are difficult to visualize at Mercator projection - Curved paths make overlapping routes distinguishable - Color-coding by airline reveals carrier-specific patterns - Interactive Plotly maps allow exploration of detailed routes\n\n\n6.4 Assumptions Made\n\nTemporal assumption: Diversions within 12 hours are part of same event\nDestination assumption: Diversions to same destination within time window are related\nIndependence: Clusters separated by &gt;12 hours are treated as independent events",

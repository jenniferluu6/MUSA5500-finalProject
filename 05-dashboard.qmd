## Overview

This page documents the interactive Panel dashboard developed to explore flight diversion patterns. The dashboard allows users to filter and analyze diversions in real-time using multiple interactive controls.

---

## Dashboard Features

### Interactive Filters

The dashboard includes three main filters that work together to subset the data:

**1. Airline Selection**
- Multi-select dropdown to choose one or more airlines
- Default: Top 3 airlines by diversion count
- Enables airline-specific analysis and comparison

**2. Date Range Slider**
- Specify custom date ranges (July 2021 - December 2024)
- Allows temporal analysis of diversions
- Supports seasonal pattern exploration

**3. Dynamic Summary Statistics**
- Updates automatically when filters change
- Displays:
  - Total diversions in filtered dataset
  - Number of unique diversion airports
  - Average departure delay (in minutes)

### Visualizations

#### Top Diversion Airports Map
- Interactive geographic map showing the top 15 diversion airports
- Marker size represents frequency of diversions
- Hover over airports to see exact diversion counts
- Allows geographic pattern identification

**What it shows**: Which airports are receiving the most diverted flights during the selected time period and for chosen airlines.

**How to interpret**: Larger circles = more diversions. Geographic clusters suggest regional capacity issues.

#### Diversions by Airline Bar Chart
- Vertical bar chart ranking airlines by diversion count
- Colors distinguish between airlines
- Hover for exact numbers

**What it shows**: How diversions are distributed across airlines in your filtered dataset.

**How to interpret**: Comparison of operational disruption frequency by carrier. May reflect differences in route networks, fleet size, or operational practices.

#### Summary Statistics Cards
- Three key metrics displayed prominently
- Background colors for quick visual scanning
- Update in real-time as filters change

**Metrics**:
1. **Total Diversions** (Blue) - Sum of all diversions matching filters
2. **Diversion Airports** (Purple) - Count of unique airports receiving diversions
3. **Avg Departure Delay** (Green) - Mean delay for diverted flights

## How to Use the Dashboard

### Running Locally

To run the dashboard on your computer:
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd MUSA5500-finalProject

# Activate geospatial environment
conda activate geospatial

# Run the app
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5006`

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start with full dataset**
   - All airlines selected
   - Full date range (July 2021 - December 2024)

2. **Select airlines of interest**
   - Click on airline dropdown
   - Choose one or more carriers
   - Dashboard updates automatically

3. **Narrow date range**
   - Use date slider to focus on time period
   - Helpful for identifying seasonal patterns
   - Can zoom into specific disruption events

4. **Analyze results**
   - Check summary statistics
   - Explore geographic distribution on map
   - Compare airlines using bar chart

### Example Analyses

**Find Peak Diversion Periods**
- Set date range to one month
- Select all airlines
- Identify which airports spike in activity

**Compare Airline Performance**
- Set date range to full dataset
- Select one airline at a time
- Compare summary statistics across carriers

**Explore Regional Events**
- Focus on date range when you know a disruption occurred
- Select relevant airlines
- Analyze geographic concentration of diversions

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Panel (by HoloViz)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas
- **Visualization**: Plotly
- **Data Source**: BTS OTMC-OTP database (2021-2024)

### Cross-Filtering Implementation
The dashboard uses Panel's reactive decorators (`@pn.depends()`) to automatically update all visualizations when any filter changes. This means:
- Changing airline selection updates the map and chart
- Adjusting date range recalculates all statistics
- All changes are instantaneous (no need to click "Update")

### Performance
- Dashboard loads 8,651 total diversion records
- Filtering operations complete in <1 second
- Map rendering optimized for smooth interaction

## Insights from Dashboard

### Key Patterns Observable

**Geographic Concentration**
The map clearly shows which airports serve as primary diversion hubs. Common patterns include:
- West Coast: ONT, PHX, LAX, SFO
- Texas: IAH, DFW, SAT, AUS
- Midwest: IND, STL, MKE
- Southeast: ATL, MIA, MCO

**Airline Variation**
Significant differences exist in diversion frequency by airline, driven by:
- Route network size and destinations served
- Fleet composition and aircraft types
- Operational practices and disruption management
- Timing of analysis period (some airlines may have more flights during studied period)

**Temporal Patterns**
Using the date range filter reveals:
- Peak diversion activity in winter months (December)
- Regional variations in seasonal patterns
- Major disruption events concentrated around specific dates

### Using Dashboard for Decision-Making

**For Airlines:**
- Identify routes with highest diversion risk
- Plan capacity and staffing for vulnerable airports
- Compare performance to competitors

**For Airports:**
- Understand diversion traffic patterns
- Plan for overflow capacity during peak periods
- Coordinate with other regional airports

**For Researchers:**
- Explore relationships between variables
- Generate hypotheses about disruption causes
- Validate findings from other analyses

---

## Limitations

- **No causal information**: Dashboard shows patterns but not causes
- **Historical data only**: Cannot predict future diversions
- **Aggregated view**: Individual flight details not shown
- **Weather context missing**: No concurrent weather data available
- **First diversion only**: Secondary diversions not tracked

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to dashboard:

1. **Add weather overlay** - Show weather conditions during diversion periods
2. **Animated time series** - Play through months/years to see patterns evolve
3. **Route-specific analysis** - Filter by origin and destination airports
4. **Delay correlation** - Show relationship between diversion frequency and delays
5. **Predictive model** - Use ML to predict diversion likelihood for future flights
6. **Download data** - Export filtered dataset as CSV
